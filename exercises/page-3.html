            <h2>The Giant of the Giant's Causeway</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a magical emerald land called Ireland. In the northern stretches of this land, there lived an Irish giant called Fionn McCool (or in Irish, Fionn Mac Cumhaill).</p>

            <p>Fionn McCool is one of Ireland’s most prominent mythological characters, and yes he is who’s credited with building the Giant’s Causeway. It was built as a result of a proposed fistfight with a Scottish giant that never actually happened because Fionn and his wife tricked him instead. It ended with Fionn’s wife cleverly disguising her husband as a baby.</p>

            <p>Supposedly, his Scottish rival ran away in terror at what surely must be a massive giant if his baby was that big, tearing up the causeway behind him.</p>

            <p>Tales of tragic lovers exist in many cultures – most famously, Shakespeare’s doomed lovers, Romeo and Juliet. Ireland has its own pair of tragic and doomed lovers, Diarmuid and Grainne.</p>

            <p>The story goes that Diarmuid stole his chieftain Fionn McCool’s intended bride, Grainne, after the couple fell in love. Their love was so strong that Diarmuid and Grainne decided to escape together and went on the run indefinitely.</p>

            <p>Legend has it that Diarmuid and Grainne never slept in the same place twice and across Ireland, there are dozens – perhaps hundreds – of “Diarmuid and Grainne beds” – caves, nooks, rocks, dolmans, Neolithic tombs, boulders, glacial erratics, and other standout geological formations where the couple supposedly spent a night while on the run. Until their luck ran out, and they were caught.</p>

            <h2>The Children of Lir</h2>
            <p>The mighty Lir was once a great king of Ireland. With his first wife, he had four lovely children. But after her untimely death, King Lir remarried a new queen, and like any proper fairytale, the stepmother did not have her new children’s best interests at heart. And unfortunately for them, his new wife grew increasingly jealous of Lir’s attention to his children, and that she dabbled in magic.</p>

            <p>Essentially, the myth of the Children of Lir is the story of the jealous stepmother. The evil queen took her revenge upon the four children for taking up so much of King Lir’s time and love by turning them into four white swans.</p>

            <p>As swans, the evil queen cursed the four children of Lir to wander Ireland as swans for 900 years.</p>

            <p>Ireland’s myths are full of fierce women, and none more legendary than the Pirate Queen herself, Gráinne Mhaol or Granuaile.</p>

            <p>A seafaring chieftain, mother, warrior, and political powerhouse, Gráinne defied expectations and commanded respect in a world ruled by men. Her story is more than myth — it’s a testament to strength, resilience, and the enduring power of legend.</p>

            <h2>The Goddess Ériu</h2>
            <p>The Irish goddess Ériu, now more commonly known as Éire, is the origin of the name, Ireland. The name of our country was bestowed in honour of this formidable goddess.</p>

            <p>Alongside her goddess-sisters Banba and Fódla, Ériu and her siblings collectively hold the title of Goddesses of Sovereignty. Given this prestigious role and heritage, Ériu is a befitting name for Ireland.</p>

            <p><b>St Brigid… saint or pagan princess? </b> of the “history” of St Brigid of Kildare has been based more on myth and legend than actual historical records. In fact, there is some debate over whether she was even a real person.</p>

            <p>Brigid (or Brigit, as it is sometimes spelt) is also the name of a Celtic goddess from pre-Christian, early medieval Ireland. She is an established member of Irish mythology as part of the ancient mythical race of fairies, the Tuatha Dé Danann.</p>

            <p>Sharing a feast day – February 1st, Ireland’s newest bank holiday – similar attributes, the same name and falling at a similar time in history, it’s impossible not to connect these two impressive female figures – and many historians and folklorists have done so over the years. So, who was she – a saint or a goddess? Learn more about Brigid below.</p>
